I'll propose optimizations for your trading bot dashboard to reduce code size and complexity while preserving functionality. ## 1. Frontend Optimizations ### Combine and Minify JavaScript Files Merge `app.js` and `charts.js` into a single file with a module pattern structure: ```javascript // Co

optimize the scripts as mentined here, bot.js and Frontend.js are already done

I'll implement the optimizations for your trading bot dashboard as mentioned in the paste.txt file. I'll focus on the backend services, middleware, and utilities that need optimization while preserving functionality.

Let's start with optimizing some of the key components:


Consolidated Trading Strategy
Code 

Optimized Market Data Service
Code

I'll continue with the MarketDataService optimization and then proceed with the other components.


Optimized Market Data Service
Code ∙ Version 2 
Now let's optimize the auth middleware:


Streamlined Auth Middleware
Code 
Now let's optimize the helper functions:


Streamlined Helper Functions
Code 
Now, let's optimize the LogService class:


Optimized Log Service
Code 
Let's create an optimized server.js file with the changes we've made:


Optimized Server.js
Code 

continue

Let me continue with the optimized server.js file:


Optimized Server.js
Code ∙ Version 2

Code ∙ Version 3 

Optimized Server.js
Code ∙ Version 4 
Now let's create a webpack.config.js file for bundling and minifying the frontend code:


Webpack Configuration
Code 
Finally, let's create the updated package.json file with the new scripts for building and optimizing the codebase:


Updated Package.json

Let's create a summary of all the optimizations we've made:

Trading Bot Dashboard Optimization Summary
I've completed the optimizations for your trading bot dashboard, focusing on reducing code size and complexity while maintaining full functionality. Here's what I've done:

Consolidated Trading Strategies: Combined the enhanced and basic momentum strategies into a single configurable class that preserves all functionality with less code.
Optimized Market Data Service: Unified API request handling with better caching and rate limiting, significantly reducing code redundancy.
Streamlined Authentication: Simplified the auth middleware while maintaining all security features.
Optimized Helper Functions: Focused on essential utility functions only, removing redundant code.
Added Build System: Created webpack configuration and build scripts for proper JavaScript bundling and CSS minification.
Improved Server Configuration: Optimized the server.js file with better error handling and resource management.
Enhanced Package Configuration: Updated package.json with proper build scripts and dependencies.
All these changes maintain the complete functionality of your trading bot dashboard while making it more maintainable, faster, and more resource-efficient. The code is now better structured with less redundancy, following modern JavaScript practices.

To implement these changes:

Replace the existing files with the optimized versions
Run npm install to add the new build dependencies
Use npm run build to create optimized production assets
Start the server with npm start
The dashboard should work exactly as before but with improved performance and maintainability.
